## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MissingRuby-CLI.git
    cd MissingRuby-CLI
    ```
2. Run the game:
    ```
    python case_of_missing_ruby.py
    ```
    
### Usage

Simply follow the in-game prompts to navigate the investigation, collect clues, and solve the mystery.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Begin by entering your detective name.
2. Investigate three key locations:
   - Curator's Office
   - Security Booth
   - Ruby's Display Case
3. Gather clues and formulate your theory.
4. At any time, type `solve` to make your accusation:
   - Choose one suspect or all three.
   - Success reveals the full conspiracy; incorrect guesses end the game.
5. Type `quit` to exit and end the investigation.

## üóÇ Code Structure

The game logic revolves around a continuous loop that:
- Prompts the player for investigation or to solve the case
- Validates inputs and tracks discovered clues
- Checks player accusations against the true culprit(s)
- Provides descriptive feedback and game progression

Example:
```
while True:
    choice = input("Your choice: ").lower()
    if choice == "quit":
        break
    elif choice == "solve":
        # logic for accusation and result
    else:
        # investigation logic
```


## üìù Sample Gameplay
