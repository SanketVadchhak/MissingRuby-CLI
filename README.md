   - Ruby's Display Case

## Code Structure

The main game logic is handled in a perpetual loop:
while True:
# Prompt for investigation, solving, or quitting
# Check for discovered clues at each location
# Validate user input
# On 'solve', prompt for final accusation, check outcome
# On 'quit', exit
Unique clues, victory conditions, and prompts are displayed based on player actions, with tailored feedback at each stage.
